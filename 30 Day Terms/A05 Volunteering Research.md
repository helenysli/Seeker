#### 美国志愿服务总体在下降

Independent Sector 2019年末做了一个专题「重新想象志愿服务」，在 [Bees and Volunteers: Both Need Our Attention Now — Independent Sector 191122](https://independentsector.org/news-post/bees-and-volunteers-both-need-our-attention-now/) 一文中，

- Nationally, volunteerism rates have been declining for 15 years, and recent reports cite a drop from a high of 28.8% to 24.9%.  [Where Are America's Volunteers | Do Good Institute](https://dogood.umd.edu/research-impact/publications/where-are-americas-volunteers) 181024
- In California, two-thirds of volunteer centers have closed in the last decade, an indicator of the decline in infrastructure and thought leadership in volunteerism.

Volunteer U 在[6 Volunteering Trends to Watch in 2020 - Volunteer U](https://volunteeru.org/6-volunteering-trends-to-watch-in-2020/) 一文中，提到2020年的6个趋势；这篇文章，只是观点，不算基于研究的趋势：

- 志愿者日益希望不仅是贡献时间，而且能够投入技能：摄影、绘画、社交媒体运营、项目组织设计等等，都是志愿者大显身手的空间
- 网络志愿者越来越普遍，因为能突破时间和物理空间的局限。同样也在超越简单的时间付出（例如发放问卷、文字转录一类）
- 代际差异很鲜明，预计 Gen Z 会爬升
- 培训越来越重要【这篇文章里没有说明为什么；但提到，75% 的组织都没有培训志愿者】
- 招募越来越多地通过社交媒体来实现
- 在线捐赠大幅增长

#### 其它渠道呈现的趋势

Corporation of National Community Service 2018年11月底的 中说，

> Millions more are supporting friends and family (43.1 percent) and doing favors for their neighbors (51.4 percent), suggesting that many are engaged in acts of “informal volunteering.”

刚开始有点不理解，帮助家人、邻居也算志愿服务吗？仔细一想，也算的。 甚至学生在班级里主动做点事，应该都算 Volunteer。我只是不应该把它和「Philanthropy」混淆了。不是所有的 Volunteering 都是 Philanthropy。

但再一想，我之前对 Volunteer 的经济规模的理解，也有错误。我以为这是对非营利部门经济规模的补充，因为 assumtion 就是，volunteer 都是帮助非营利组织的。

但现在看来，Volunteer 帮助家人、朋友这部分，也有可能是对商业的补充，因为如果没有 Volunteer 的帮助，家人、朋友可能会需要购买商业产品或服务。

## 研究证明志愿服务有益身心健康



### Physical Health

### 为两个或两个以上的组织服务，死亡率降低44%

Related: 

In examining the volunteer habits of individuals from four age groups (55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and older), one study looked for predictors of mortality five years later based on the frequency of volunteering. 

The study found that those who volunteered with two or more organizations experienced 44 percent lower mortality rates over a five-year period than those elderly persons who did not volunteer, even after adjusting for other factors such as age, health habits, and social support. Indeed, volunteering was found to contribute more to lower mortality rates than high religious involvement or perceived social support. (Oman et al., 1999)

上面这个好是好，但主要是对老人而言啊。

### Mental Health

### 志愿服务增强社交纽带和意义感

志愿服务能增强社交纽带，尤其是在困难时刻能避免个人陷入孤立(isolation）；同时，帮助别人往往能带来更高的价值感和信任。

research also suggests that volunteer activities offer those who serve more than just a social network to provide support and alleviate stress; volunteering also provides individuals with a sense of purpose and life satisfaction. In fact:

- A study of adults age 65 and older found that the positive effect of volunteering on physical and mental health is due to the personal sense of accomplishment that an individual gains from his or her volunteer activities. (Herzog et al., 1998)

- Volunteering can provide a sense of purpose, as found in a study of older adults; according to this study, formal volunteering moderated the loss of a sense of purpose among older adults who had experienced the loss of major role identities, such as wage-earner and parent. (Greenfield and Marks, 2004)

- A study of older adults found that participation in community service was more strongly correlated with life satisfaction for retirees than for those individuals who continued to work for pay. (Harlow and Cantor, 1996)

### 志愿者和社区融合更好

Across all categories in the study, volunteers engage in their communities at higher rates than non-volunteers. They more frequently talk to neighbors, participate in civic organizations, fix things in the community, attend public meetings, discuss local issues with family and friends, do favors for neighbors, and vote in local elections.

Data from interviews conducted in 1956 and 1986 of a group of women in an upstate New York community found that those women who had volunteered on an intermittent basis from the time that they married until the age of 55 scored higher on functional ability in 1986 than those who had not; 4 this finding was significant even when controlling for socioeconomic status and previous illness. Those who had volunteered were more likely to occupy multiple roles in later years, indicating greater social integration. At the same time, a negative relation was found between health and paid work and caregiving. The researchers for this study posit that these outcomes may be due to the degree of autonomy that the women had in engaging in different activities: while volunteering was typically a discretionary activity, caregiving and paid employment were generally required of them. 5 (Moen et al., 1992)

#### 志愿服务多长时间合适

##### 研究1：100小时是志愿服务的门槛

Keywords: 
Source: Report The Health Benefit of Volunteering annotated, p11
Related: 

Two studies of data collected through the Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old Survey both found that the volunteering threshold is 100 hours per year, or about two hours a week. Typically, no or little relationship was found between volunteering and positive health outcomes when an individual engaged in less than 100 hours per year. There did not appear to be any additional benefits to health as the number of volunteer hours increased beyond 100 hours. (Lum and Lightfoot, 2005 and Luoh and Herzog, 2002)

似乎仍然是老人

##### 研究2：至少40小时

Keywords: 
Source: Report The Health Benefit of Volunteering annotated, p11
Related: 

A study of the Americans’ Changing Lives survey found a more moderate level of volunteering was necessary for health benefits. Those individuals who volunteered at least 40 hours per year, as well as those who volunteered with just one organization, or group, had the lowest risk of mortality. 7 (Musick et al., 1999)

一项研究表明，适度的志愿服务对于健康很重要。每年服务40小时以上的人，即使只为1个组织服务，在所调查的人群中，拥有最低的死亡风险。

我的理解是，这和100小时不冲突。100小时也是「至少40小时」，只是上面这个100小时的研究更精确。 

#### 为什么目前关于志愿服务身心健康的研究，主要是针对老人？

1）很多年纪轻的人，参与志愿服务，可能是出于外在压力（学校要求）或义务（如父母带孩子参加、父母为孩子学校服务），所以不能体现服务的真实意愿。
2）相对于年轻人，老人更容易出现健康上的问题，更容易监测志愿服务的影响。

## Virtual Volunteering

#### Virtual Volunteering 的定义

在线志愿服务，是指志愿者通过网络技术，即使不到现场，也能为公益项目、公益组织提供服务。它也被称为「数字志愿服务」（Digital Volunteering）或者「电子志愿服务」（E-volunteering）

 [How to Become a Virtual Volunteer](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/becoming-a-virtual-volunteer-4138357) 一文，这样说，

> Virtual volunteering allows you to commit your time and services away from the physical site of an organization, project, or campaign. Virtual volunteers work over the internet via computer, tablet or phone to provide their skilled services to support a cause that is important to them.

> It's also called cyber-volunteers,” “digital volunteers,” or even “e-volunteers.” 

#### 名称的由来

The term “virtual volunteer” was first referenced in 1995 by Steve Glikbarg, co-founder of Impact Online. It became a way to distinguish the new work volunteers were doing outside of traditional volunteering roles. Glikbarg’s company later became VolunteerMatch, one of the biggest online databases that match volunteers to organizations.

#### Virtual Volunteering 怎么翻译

台湾译为:网络志愿者；但这个网络，可能会误解为「社交网络」或者「人际网络」

最不动脑子的翻译是「虚拟志愿者」，但「虚拟」这个词，很容易和「虚拟现实」中的虚拟搞混。例如：
- 在[云端防疫、虚拟志愿者…郑州这支青春志愿者服务队“黑科技”加持赴疫线_网易新闻 200220](http://henan.163.com/20/0229/13/F6IAFQOF04398SNL.html) 中，提到：虚拟志愿者，硬核科技助智控；AI虚拟志愿者通过电话二次高效排查返郑人员身份、活动区域、体征情况等信息，实时更新、不留盲区。
- 在[上海首次设立虚拟交通安全宣传志愿者 191202](https://k.sina.cn/article_1784473157_v6a5ce64502001l224.html?from=news&subch=onews) 中，虚拟志愿者似乎是一个动漫风的虚拟人物。

上面这两种不太好的翻译，都是因为借用了一个已经存在的词，撞车打架；尤其是「虚拟」这个词，仍然在演化中。【🔗2003062049 皮亚杰旧词新用】

我考虑过「远程志愿者」，但英语里 Long-Distance，又暗指了距离很远。而 virtual volunteer 未必是远距离的，只是强调不用physically present。

我打算翻译为「在线志愿者」，中英文都没有歧义。虽然这个词，无法包括「电话志愿」这种形态，不过电话志愿者也日渐式微。

#### Virtual Volunteering 为什么会兴起

在线志愿服务，近年来盛行，有两个重要的原因：一是因为互联网及各种协作工具，使远程工作和协作，变得越来越容易；这就让很多有心参与志愿服务，却受制于时间、交通的人，有了服务的机会；二是公益慈善组织越来越多地利用互联网和社交媒体开展工作、传播沟通，对于技术和网络相关技能的需求，也越来越大。

原文是这样说的

- 很多技能可以通过网络来实现：The internet has allowed us to do so much more in much less time, and our skills are no longer limited to our geographical location. More skill sets have stemmed from society's use of technology, as well. Because of that, volunteering is no longer limited to just physical labor or attendance.

- 很多组织的工作也日益需要网络运营：Organizations need websites as well as “boots on the ground.” They need help with their social media and assistance in the community.


形式

That service takes many forms, including:

- Website design or support
- Data entry
- Email marketing or management
- Fundraising phone calls and outreach
- Social media promotion and management
- App development
- Volunteer tracking
- Copywriting, blogging, or editing
- Graphic design, photography
- Marketing or branding assistance
- Video creation
- Virtual assistance, staff support



#### 众包是一个令人兴奋的趋势

 [如何成为虚拟志愿者](https://zhcn.unitinal.com/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E8%99%9A%E6%8B%9F%E5%BF%97%E6%84%BF%E8%80%85/) 一文，这么说：

> 一个令人兴奋的新领域是能够将数据众包给人文和科学研究。例如，历史爱好者可以与史密森尼协作来帮助使历史文档可访问。 观鸟者可以通过eBird帮助追踪鸟类种群和迁徙模式。 业余天文学家可以帮助Zooniverse绘制天空。 


对于志愿者来说，虚拟志愿者可能意味着：

- 有更多机会为多种事业和组织提供志愿服务
- 有更多的时间来做志愿者
- 调度的灵活性，地点和参与程度
- 一个独特的技能或激情的出路，不被物理志愿者所满足
- 为残疾人或非常偏远的志愿者提供更多职位
- 实现教育或职业志愿者里程碑

#### 代表人物

Jayne Cravens, the author of The Last Virtual Volunteering Guidebook, has studied the benefits of virtual volunteering for many years. 


#### 典型的例子

Virtual volunteering is nothing new. Volunteers have been operating on the world wide web since the earliest beginnings of the internet (think Project Gutenberg, Wikipedia, Librivox, and other digitized community projects).

❓这些应该算众包吧? 


#### ❓众包和在线志愿服务的区别是什么？
字面上很好理解，通过在线完成的众包服务，就是在线志愿，如 Wikipedia

但是，有什么样的众包服务，不是通过在线完成的呢？如果是那样的话，应该就不是众包了吧？

### 在线志愿服务兴起的原因

Keywords: 
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_volunteering
Related: 

in one study,[2] over 70 per cent of online volunteers chose assignments requiring one to five hours a week and nearly half chose assignments lasting 12 weeks or less. Some organizations offer online volunteering opportunities which last from ten minutes to an hour. A unique feature of online volunteering is that it can be done from a distance. People with restricted mobility or other special needs participate in ways that might not be possible in traditional face-to-face volunteering. Likewise, online volunteering may allow people to overcome social inhibitions and social anxiety, particularly if they would normally experience disability-related labeling or stereotyping. This empowers people who might not otherwise volunteer. It can build self-confidence and self-esteem while enhancing skills and extending networks and social ties. Online volunteering also allows participants to adapt their program of volunteer work to their unique skills and passions.[3]

网上志愿服务之所以会兴起，很大程度上是因为它非常灵活，志愿者可以根据自己的时间和独特的技能来安排志愿服务；此外，它还让一些行动受限的人、有社交恐惧的人，也能参与服务。

People engaged in virtual volunteering undertake a variety of activities from locations remote to the organization or people they are assisting, via a computer or other Internet-connected device, such as:

researching subjects (e.g. for Wikia projects)
writing software (see open-source software which is often made by volunteers)
fixing software (e.g. Community patches)
creating web pages
editing or writing proposals, press releases, newsletter articles, etc.
translating documents (e.g. Fan translations)
developing material for a curriculum

### 联合国在线服务

The UN's Online Volunteering service connects organizations working in or for the developing world with online volunteers. It does have statistics available regarding numbers of online volunteers and involving organizations (i.e. NGOs, other civil society organizations, a government or other public institutions, United Nations agencies or other intergovernmental institutions) that collaborate online via their platform. In 2013, all 17,370 online volunteering assignments offered by development organizations through the Online Volunteering service attracted applications from numerous qualified volunteers. About 58 percent of the 11,037 online volunteers were women, and 60 percent came from developing countries; on average, they were 30 years of age. More than 94 percent of organizations and online volunteers rated their collaboration as good or excellent in 2013.[24] For civil society organizations with limited resources in particular, the impact of online volunteer engagement is significant: 41% involve UN Online Volunteers for technical expertise that is not available internally. According to the same impact evaluation carried out in 2014, in many instances, organizations without access to online volunteers would have difficulties achieving their own peace and development outcomes.[25]

联合国的在线志愿服务将在发展中世界或为发展中世界工作的组织与在线志愿人员联系起来。 它确实有关于在线志愿人员人数和通过其平台在线协作的组织（即非政府组织，其他民间社会组织，政府或其他公共机构，联合国机构或其他政府间机构）的统计数据。 2013年，发展组织通过在线志愿服务提供的所有17 370项在线志愿服务任务都吸引了众多合格志愿人员的申请。 11,037名在线志愿者中约58%为女性，60%来自发展中国家； 他们平均年龄为30岁。 2013年，94%以上的组织和在线志愿人员将其合作评为良好或优秀。[24]特别是对资源有限的民间社会组织而言，在线志愿人员参与的影响非常显著:41%的组织让联合国在线志愿人员参与获得内部无法获得的技术专门知识。 根据2014年进行的同一影响评价，在许多情况下，没有在线志愿人员的组织将难以实现自身的和平与发展成果

## MicroVolunteering

定义
Many of these crowdsourcing opportunities fall into the unique category of micro-volunteering because one can perform them in just snippets of time and the tasks may not require formal training or qualification.

### 定义

#### Wikipedia 的定义

Keywords: 
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-volunteering
Related: 

Micro-volunteering describes a volunteer, or team of volunteers, completing small tasks that make up a larger project. These tasks often benefit a research, charitable, or non-governmental organization. It differs from normal volunteerism as the tasks take only minutes to a few hours, and the volunteer does not make a long-term commitment. As a form of virtual volunteering, the tasks are usually distributed and completed online via an internet-connected device, including smartphones. It typically does not require an application process, screening or training period, takes only minutes or a few hours to complete, and does not require an ongoing commitment by the volunteer.

微型志愿服务（micro-voluntering）描述的是一个志愿者或一组志愿者，完成组成一个更大项目的小任务。 这些任务通常有利于研究，慈善或非政府组织。 它与正常的志愿服务不同，因为这些任务只需要几分钟到几个小时，而且志愿人员不会做出长期的承诺。 作为虚拟志愿服务的一种形式，这些任务通常通过包括智能手机在内的连接互联网的设备在网上分发和完成。 它通常不需要申请过程，筛选或培训时间，只需几分钟或几小时就能完成，也不需要志愿者的持续承诺。

Related: 

Essentially, microvolunteering is volunteering in small bursts, at times and places that are convenient. Microvolunteering is similar to many other forms of volunteerism, including “byte-sized volunteering,” “episodic volunteering,” “virtual volunteering” and more.

Because so much of volunteerism has gone virtual, this concept isn’t entirely new. Today, everyone can volunteer in some way from wherever he or she is, thanks to smartphones and access to the internet. Of course, micro-volunteers don’t have to be just online; finding short-term volunteer opportunities near you count, too.

从本质上说，微志愿服务是在方便的时间和地点进行小范围的志愿服务。 微志愿服务类似于许多其他形式的志愿服务，包括“字节大小的志愿服务”，“片段式志愿服务”，“虚拟志愿服务”等。

因为很多志愿服务都是虚拟的，所以这个概念并不是全新的。 今天，由于智能手机和互联网的接入，每个人都可以从任何地方以某种方式做志愿者。 当然，微志愿者不必只是在线； 在你身边找到短期的志愿者机会也很重要。

Online micro-volunteering is also an example of virtual volunteering and crowdsourcing, where volunteers undertake assignments via their PDAs or smartphones. These volunteers either aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for such tasks, and do not have to make any other commitment when a micro-task is completed, or, have already undergone screening or training by the nonprofit, and are therefore approved to take on micro-tasks as their availability and interests allow. Online micro-volunteering was originally called "byte-sized volunteering" by the Virtual Volunteering Project, and has always been a part of the more than 30-year-old practice of online volunteering.[9] An early example of both micro-volunteering and crowdsourcing is ClickWorkers, a small NASA project begun in 2001 that engaged online volunteers in scientific-related tasks that required just a person's perception and common sense, but not scientific training, such as identifying craters on Mars in photos the project posted online; volunteers were not trained or screened before participating. The phrase "micro-volunteering" is usually credited to a San Francisco-based nonprofit called The Extraordinaries.[10][11][12]

在线微型志愿服务也是虚拟志愿服务和众包的一个例子，志愿人员通过他们的PDA或智能手机执行任务。 这些志愿者或者不需要接受非营利性组织的任何筛选或培训，并且在完成一项微型任务时不必做出任何其他承诺，或者，已经接受了非营利性组织的筛选或培训，因此在他们的能力和兴趣允许的情况下被批准承担微型任务。 在线微型志愿服务最初被虚拟志愿服务项目称为“字节大小的志愿服务”，一直是30多年的在线志愿服务实践的一部分。[9]微型志愿服务和众包服务的一个早期例子是ClickWorkers，这是2001年开始的一个小型NASA项目，它让在线志愿人员从事与科学有关的任务，这些任务只需要一个人的感知和常识，但不需要科学培训，例如在该项目在网上发布的照片中识别火星上的陨石坑； 志愿者在参与之前没有经过培训或筛选。 “微型志愿服务”一词通常被认为是总部设在旧金山的非营利性组织The Extraordinaries的名字。[10][11][12]

Related: 

Skills-based volunteering (SBV) is an innovative approach that is rapidly gaining recognition as a powerful driver of both social impact and business value. Skills-based volunteerism utilizes the skills, experience, talents and education of volunteers and matches them with the needs of nonprofits. By leveraging all types of knowledge and expertise, SBV helps build and sustain nonprofits’ capacity to achieve their missions successfully. Individual skilled volunteers may offer their particular expertise to a nonprofit agency, while corporate SBV involves employee volunteers working on projects for a nonprofit organization through a structured program developed and managed by their employer.

基于技能志愿服务(SBV)是一种创新的方法，正迅速获得认可，成为社会影响和商业价值的强大推动力。 它利用志愿者的技能、经验、才能和教育，并使他们与非营利组织的需要相匹配。 

通过利用各种类型的知识和专长，SBV帮助增强和维护非营利组织成功实现其使命的能力。 

个人技术熟练的志愿者可以向非营利机构提供他们的特殊专业知识，而企业SBV则涉及员工志愿者通过由雇主开发和管理的结构化计划为非营利组织的项目工作。

Skills-based volunteering is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions.[9] This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where volunteers doing something other than his / her professional work.[10] The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $18–20 an hour.[11] Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40–500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time.

基于技能的志愿服务是利用个人的专门技能和才干来为非营利组织服务，帮助他们更好地实现组织的使命。在传统志愿服务中，志愿者参与的任务，不一定和自己的工作或专长相关。

美国「独立部门」这个组织，专门统计志愿服务所创造的经济价值。他们对传统志愿服务的平均估价大约在每小时18-20美元，而基于技能的志愿服务的小时估价为40-500美元。

The research also found that Americans are generous with more than just their time. Volunteers donate to charity at twice the rate as non-volunteers. Nearly 80 percent of volunteers donated to charity, compared to 40 percent of non-volunteers.  Overall, half of all citizens (52.2 percent) donated to charity last year. 

启发 🎇

- 对于非营利组织，要想人捐款，先把他们拉来做志愿者；
- 对于公司而言，想要找人，先拉一批志愿者也是好的，从志愿者中来培养
