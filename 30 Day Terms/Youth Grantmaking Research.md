### [2019 Giving](https://www.rivers.org/news-detail?pk=1020440#) 
- The Givers program is open to juniors and seniors; participants are required to attend four workshops throughout the year as the group decides how best to distribute the money it raises through various events such as T-shirt sales and dress-down days. The program was established in 2002 and raises about USD5,000 for charitable giving each year. (The Parents’ Association provides matching dollars, so the group donates about USD10,000 annually).
- Receipients
	- Waltham Boys & Girls Club, shared a story about a teen struggling with complex family issues who found support and purpose through the club’s programs. The grant money, said LeBlanc and Limonciello, will allow young Boys & Girls Club members to attend a national conference.
	- New England Disabled Sports, who shared an inspiring video showing disabled young people participating in various activities through the use of adaptive equipment. The Rivers Givers grant, she said, will allow NEDS to purchase a special sit ski that can be used by people with lower-limb impairments.	
	- Family Services Institute, gave an impassioned presentation describing IFSI’s work with newly arrived families, mostly from Haiti, as they integrate into American society and culture. She described the organization as “a bridge that connects children with services.” She continued, “I cannot thank you enough” for the Rivers Givers grant money, which will go toward hiring a new program director.
- Students Gain
	- Kit Cunningham, They are gaining some understanding about how to make a difference.
	- Addy Vettel: Being a part of Rivers Givers this year has really opened me up to the world of community service and philanthropy,” says Addy Vettel ’20. “I had done a good amount of community service before this club, but I never knew about the behind-the-scenes work and the systems that went into play. In this club, I was educated about the social, financial, and political aspects of community service and the different roles that they have.”
	- Mark Ryan: The best feature about the Rivers Givers program is being able to see where the money we donate goes. As part of the Rivers Givers program, we’re able to visit the organizations and see if the money raised should be given to one program or another. While this decision making is tough, we know that it’s important to donate the funds where we believe they will best be used. The decision-making process is similar to making certain decisions in everyday life. The Rivers Givers program reminds us to be thoughtful and mindful—which helps us grow philanthropically.”

### [The 10th Annual Check Presentation](https://www.rivers.org/news-detail?pk=664726)
- Each year since the group’s inception in 2003, the Rivers Givers host several service initiatives throughout the school year to reach an annual fundraising goal of $10,000. 
- The Givers were forced to be thorough in their decision-making. The process included visits to each organization’s site, as well as detailed discussion and debate between students regarding where the Givers’ grants would be best spent.
